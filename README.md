# Project Sofra
**Project Sofra** is a location-based platform designed to help you find affordable meals when restaurants are closed and your budget is tight. By inputting a distance in meters, you can send your location to the backend using Google Maps API. The backend then performs a `BETWEEN` query on the database to list products that are within the specified distance from your location.

## Key Features
- Proximity-Based Search: Only displays food options within the specified distance from your current location.
- Google Maps Integration: Visualize nearby food options on the map with markers indicating available meals.
- User Interaction: Both buyers and sellers of food items are part of the platform, with real-time data updates.

## Overview
This project was inspired by a friend's idea. Although permission was granted to use the concept, it wasn't developed into a full application. The idea remains a concept for a platform where users can both buy and sell food based on their proximity, leveraging Google Maps for location accuracy and visualization.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (with Bootstrap for styling)
